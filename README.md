# Learning Curves

🎯 In this project I will cover:

- Learning Curves
- Bias
- Variance
- Polynomial Features
- Necessary training size

I will be guided through interpreting the learning curves and understanding how model complexity affects my results and how you can prevent underfitting and overfitting.

## The dataset 🏀

I will be diving deeper into the NBA dataset from Challenge 1. The dataset contains statistics of 4000 NBA players, including:

- `season`: The season (yearly) the player played in
- `poss`: Possessions played
- `mp`: Minutes played
- `do_ratio`: A player's ratio of time spent in defense vs. offense; negative values mean more defense positioning
- `pacing`: Player impact on team possessions per 48 minutes
- `win_rating`: *Wins Above Replacement* rating, how many additional wins a player is worth over a same-level replacement

To start the project, open `Learning_Curves.ipynb` in `jupyter notebook` and follow the instructions.

🕰️ Estimated Time of Completion = 60 min
